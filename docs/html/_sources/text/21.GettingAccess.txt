If you need a WVU Login account, please make a request with `Service Desk

After getting a WVU Login Account, you will need to request access to Research
Computing systems through the
`Research Computing Help Desk <https://helpdesk.hpc.wvu.edu>`_ web page by
clicking on the 'Open a new ticket' button and selecting
'New User Account Request' under help topic.

For any additional questions regarding access, please email us at
