Connect to the cluster
======================

Hostnames
---------

 - **Mountaineer** mountaineer.hpc.wvu.edu
 - **Spruce Knob** spruce.hpc.wvu.edu

Connecting to a cluster via SSH
-------------------------------

Access to a cluster is through the SSH login protocol using a cluster's hostname.
SSH uses encryption to ensure a secure connection and therefore is preferred.
Unsecured connections through telnet clients have been disabled and will not work.
You will need an SSH client which is available with any current Unix based
operating system (including Linux and Mac OS X).
Windows users will have to acquire an SSH client, `Putty <http://www.putty.org/>`_
is a commonly used SSH client with a graphical interface and is available for
free download.  We have [[puttyIns | Putty Instructions here]].

To use a command-line SSH client available on Unix based operating systems,
open a terminal shell and type:

::

   $> ssh username@hostname

or

::

   $> ssh -Y username@hostname

Where username is your username and hostname is the name of the cluster you
wish to connect to.  The -Y option is used to forward X windows applications
running on Spruce to be forwarded to your local machine.

Logging In
----------

When your SSH access is granted, you will be prompted with a login message
(below is the Spruce Knob login message):

      Further system related information:

      - Spruce Knob utilizes the TORQUE/PBS resource manager to manage compute
         resources.

          To run an interactive shell, issue:
                qsub -I -q queue_name

          To submit a batch job, issue:       qsub job_script.sh
          To show all queued jobs, issue:     showq or qstat
          To check a job status:		checkjob <jobId>
          To kill a queued job, issue:        canceljob <jobId>

          Example PBS job scripts are located at:
          http://wiki.hpc.wvu.edu/hpc_wiki/index.php/Sample_Job_Scripts

          The following man pages provide helpful pbs information:
      	man pbs_resources_linux (How-to request cluster resources)
      	man qsub
      	man qstat

      - Spruce Knob utilizes Environment Modules to help manage different software
         packages available on the cluster.  "module avail" shows the available
         modules.

      - Spruce has two file systems available to users:
         - $HOME (permanent storage that is backed up via snapshots, 10GB Limit)
         - $SCRATCH (temporary storage that is NOT backed up, current allocation 130 TB)

      Recent Updates:

      - 2018.05.18 - Completed OS and server updates across the entire system.

Following this message, you will be prompted for your password.  Type in your
password and you will be given a command prompt.  Users logging in for the
first time, will be asked immediately to change their password.  The password
is managed with Active Directory and cannot be changed using the passwd
command in the command prompt.

Logging Out
-----------

Logging out of a cluster can be done with the exit command:

::

   $> exit

The exit command will attempt to terminate any job not running through the
queuing system.  In some cases, you will get an error that jobs are either
currently running or currently stopped.  You can view stopped jobs using the
jobs command:

::

   $> jobs -l
   [1]+ 3325 Stopped            vim script56.py

The output of jobs -l will give you the job PID number (in this case 3325) and
the command (vim script56.py).  To kill jobs preventing successful logout,
use the kill command:

::

   $> kill -s 9 3325

Once all jobs are terminated, the exit command will close the connection to host.
