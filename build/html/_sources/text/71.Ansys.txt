Engineering: ANSYS Products
===========================

Log in to Spruce
----------------

Enter on Spruce with X11 forwarding, at least on Linux it is with

::

    ssh -X <USERNAME>@spruce.hpc.wvu.edu

On Windows you can MobaXTerm and the program will give you X11
forwarding too

You can test the X11 forwarding with:

::

    xeyes

A small window with two eyes will pop up on your screen, execute CTRL-C
to exit The test will just prove that a window can be created on your
client machine.

Create an interactive job
-------------------------

Ask for an interactive job with X11 Forwarding enabled, I am using
"debug" queue, change accordingly

::

    qsub -X -I -q debug

Wait around 2 minutes to get a compute node allocated for you Different
queues could have different response times before a compute node can be
allocated to you. In general use "standby" on Spruce for Interactive
jobs to run during a 4-hour timeframe.

Load the module for ANSYS Fluids or Structures
----------------------------------------------

There are two modules corresponding to equal number of ANSYS Suites of
packages

::

    module load ansys/fluids_18.1

and

::

    module load ansys/structures_18.1

You can load one or another or both, they use the same MPI Runtime
Libraries so they are compatible to each other.

Executing the ANSYS package of your choice
------------------------------------------

Most commands will be directly accessible to you, you do not need to
enter the full path

::

    fluent

The fluent window opens and on the lower right corner you will see:

::

    /shared/software/ansys/fluids_181/ansys_inc/v181/fluent/fluent18.1.0/bin/fluent -r18.1.0 3d -alnamd64 -path/shared/software/ansys/fluids_181/ansys_inc/v181/fluent -ssh -cx sllc0001.hpc.wvu.edu:41717:33691
