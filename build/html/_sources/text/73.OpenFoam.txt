Engineering: Running OpenFOAM simple tutorial
=============================================

Load modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenFOAM was compiled with gcc 5.3.0 and openMPI 1.6.5. These
modulefiles will need to be loaded to run OpenFOAM.

::

    $> module load compilers/gcc/5.3.0 mpi/openmpi/1.6.5 libraries/openfoam/3.0+

Run OpenFOAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a sample tutorial given by OpenFOAM to show how to run OpenFOAM
on our systems. The commands below will initiate an interactive job on
the debug queue, and execute the openFoam tutorial.

::

    $> debug

    $> module load compilers/gcc/5.3.0 libraries/openfoam/3.0+
    $> mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN
    $> run
    $> cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/simpleFoam/pitzDaily ./
    $> mv pitzDaily/* .
    $> blockMesh
    $> simpleFoam

Using ParaView with OpenFoam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visualization of openFoam output can be executed from the head node. To
use paraFoam, make sure you have logged in with `X11 forwarding
enabled <Using X Windows applications>`__.

::

    $> module load compilers/gcc/5.3.0 libraries/openfoam/3.0+ visualization/paraview
    $> run
    $> paraFoam
