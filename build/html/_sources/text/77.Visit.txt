Visualization: VisIt
====================

From: https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit

VisIt is an Open Source, interactive, scalable, visualization, animation
and analysis tool. From Unix, Windows or Mac workstations, users can
interactively visualize and analyze data ranging in scale from small
(<101 core) desktop-sized projects to large (>105 core) leadership-class
computing facility simulation campaigns. Users can quickly generate
visualizations, animate them through time, manipulate them with a
variety of operators and mathematical expressions, and save the
resulting images and animations for presentations. VisIt contains a rich
set of visualization features to enable users to view a wide variety of
data including scalar and vector fields defined on two- and
three-dimensional (2D and 3D) structured, adaptive and unstructured
meshes. Owing to its customizeable plugin design, VisIt is capabable of
visualizing data from over 120 different scientific data formats `(see
this partial
list) <http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Detailed_list_of_file_formats_VisIt_supports>`__.

Introduction
------------

VisIt is available on Spruce Knob in a client server model. In order to
utilize Visit, you will need to install a local (client) copy of VisIt
on your workstation/laptop. This will allow you to visualize your data
on your workstation but but be able to run VisIt against data stored in
Spruce Knob filesystems. For any back-end processing that VisIt might
need, it can also take advantage of Spruce Knob's processing power.

Client Installation
-------------------

By the time this wikipage was reviewed (July 19, 2017) the latest
version available was 2.12.3 released on June, 2017. Client executables
are available from
`1 <https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables>`__.
Be sure to read the install notes for your particular installation need.
In most cases you will use the 64 bit version appropriated for your OS
(Windows, Mac or Linux)

**Note:** You will need to download a version that matches an available
version on Spruce Knob. Currently we have 2.12.2 released on April 2017.
If both client and server are 2.12.x they should work correctly

Running VisIt in the Client/Server Model
----------------------------------------

After successfully installing VisIt on your workstation, you can run
through the following steps to start using it on in connection with
Spruce Knob. **Note:** The following setups up VisIt to run in Parallel
Mode but the same instructions apply for a serial run. When you enter
the number of processors you need during the submission process, just
select 1.

Configuring Client to use Spruce Knob as a Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Execute 'visit':

You can just use the icon or the command line. The command line is
useful to identify problems during the first configuration of Visit to
use Spruce as server. On MacOS the command line is accesible with:

``  /Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/visit``

-  Go-to **Options** menu and select **Host Profiles ...**.
-  In the Host profiles window, select **New** and enter the following
   information on the **Host Settings** tab.

-  Select the **Launch Profile** tab and select **New Profile** and
   enter the following information in the **Settings** sub tab.

-  Select the **Parallel** sub tab and enter the following information.
   Note, you can use a different **Queue** setting but in most cases
   standby should be sufficient unless you suspect your task will last
   longer than 4 hours.

-  Within the **Parallel** sub tab, select the **Advanced** sub tab, and
   enter **module load visualization/visit/2.10.2** in the **Sublauncher
   pre-mpi command** field. Screen should look as follows:

-  Select **Apply** in the lower left corner.
-  Select **Options** and **Save Settings** from the menu on the main
   VisIt user interface.

Connect your client to Spruce Knob
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If VisIt is not already running on your workstation, start it by
   executing **visit** on the command line.
-  Select **Open** under the **Sources** section.
-  Select **spruce.hpc.wvu.edu** in the Host Section and enter your
   password when prompt. You should see screen similar to the following.

.. image:: /_static/file_open.png
   :width: 30%
.. image:: /_static/enter_password.png
   :width: 30%

-  You should now see the contents of your home directory and ready to
   use VisIt on your local data.

Visualize an Example VisIt Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: This assumes you have already connected to Spruce Knob from your
client workstation following the instructions from the previous section.

-  Change **Path** to **/shared/software/visit/latest/data** and select
   **globe.silo**.

.. figure:: /_static/example_data.png

-  If necessary, change the options for job submission and select
   **OK**.

.. figure:: /_static/select_options.png

-  The following dialog box will appear until a spot is open on the
   cluster for your job to run. When using the standby queue, this
   should be less than 60 seconds assuming the cluster is not completely
   busy.

-  In **Plots** select **Pseudocolor** and **disp\_magnitude**.
-  Select **Draw** and you should see an output similar to the
   following.
