Job Submission
==============

Shared resources like Computer clusters are intended to be used by several people at the same time. To coordinate usage of the resources, users should request to a system called "Resource Manager" to give them access to some resources for a predefined amount of time.

The set of resources that are requested and the set of commands that you plan to execute is called a job. There are two kinds of jobs: "interactive" and "non-interactive"
