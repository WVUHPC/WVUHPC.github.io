Common Unix commands
--------------------

The Research Computing HPC server's use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system.  Many clusters around the world run exclusively Unix/Linux based operating systems.  We strongly encourage users to actively get familiar with Unix command line interface and GNU/Linux in particular.  Outstanding and Free documentation is provided at [http://www.tldp.org The Linux Documentation Project], specifically their [http://www.tldp.org/guides.html Guides] which cover basic topics including Using Linux and shell scripting to advanced File system and kernel modulization guides.  Below is a succinct list of Unix commands that will help you get started in moving around and manipulating files.

Moving around the file system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pwd``
   List current directory

``ls``
   List contents of current directory

``ls -l``
   List contents of current directory with more information per file including permissions, last edited time, and size of file

``ls -lh``
   Same as ls -lh except file size in included in 'human readable' form (gigabytes, megabytes, kilobytes)

``ls -lt``
   Same as ls -l, except list files in chronological order with newer files occurring at the top

``cd dirname``
   Changes current directory to dirname

``cd ..``
   Changes current directory up one hierarchy level

Examining Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``cat <filename>``
   Concatenates `filename` and prints to standard output (screen)

``less <filename>``
   A filter that pages through `filename` one full screen at a time.
   Allows both forward and backward movement through file

``more <filename>``
   Similar to less, except cannot move backwards through file


Manipulating Files and Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``cp <filename1> <filename2>``
   Copies `filename1` to `filename2`.  If `filename2` is the name of a directory, copies `filename1` into the directory

``cp -i <filename1> <filename2>``
   Copies `filename1` to `filename2` and ask permission before overwriting

``cp -r <directory1> <directory2>``
   Copies `directory1` and all of it's contents to `directory2`

``mv <filename1> <filename2>``
   Renames ''filename1'' to ''filename2''.  If ''filename2'' is a directory, moves ''filename1'' into directory

``mv -i <filename1> <filename2>``
   Renames ''filename1'' to ''filename2'' and ask permission before overwriting files

``rm <filename>``
   Removes file

``rm -i <filename>``
   Removes file and ask permission before doing so

``rm -r <directory>``
   Removes directory and it's contents

``rm -ir <directory>``
   Removes directory and it's contents asking permission for each file

``mkdir <directory>``
   Create a directory with ''directory'' as a name

``rmdir <directory>``
   Remove an empty directory
