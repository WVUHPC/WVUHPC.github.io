West Virginia University Research Computing (WVU-RC) is a team inside WVU's
Information Technology Services (ITS) dedicated to supporting, enabling and advancing computational research at WVU.

This site contains information about how to use the various technologies provided by the Research Computing division at West Virginia University.
Most documentation here refers to our High Performance Computing clusters but we also provide a variety of other services a large storage service called DataDepot, a DMZ (demilitarized zone) for high speed data transfers called Research Exchange (REX) and support and training in areas of High Performance Computing, Data Analysis and Parallel Programming.

There are several websites associated with WVU-RC activities, here is a list of the most relevant ones:

The official webpage in ITS portal about the Research Computing Division
   `WVU Research Computing - ITS Website <https://it.wvu.edu/research/research-computing/high-performance-computing>`_

The legacy documentation was a Wiki website continue to be online for a while
   `WVU Research Computing - Legacy Wiki <https://wiki.hpc.wvu.edu/hpc_wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_

The HelpDesk ticket system
   `WVU Research Computing - HPC HelpDesk <https://helpdesk.hpc.wvu.edu>`_

For requesting help, create a new ticket at the Research Computing HPC Help
Desk web page. You are welcome to e-mail any member of the WVU-RC team directly,
but since we are not always at our desk, the ticket system will guarantee that
