Globus Online
=============

Overview
--------

`Globus Online <https://www.globus.org/>`__ is a tool that allows WVU
researchers to \ `transfer
data <https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/>`__ between
workstations, \ `share data <https://www.globus.org/data-sharing>`__
with colleagues,
`publish datasets <https://www.globus.org/data-publication>`__, and
archive data in Google Drive for Education.

For a quick start guide please visit: `Globus: How to Get
Started <https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/>`__.

If you need further assistance beyond this documentation, please contact
helpdesk@hpc.wvu.edu.

Transfer Data
-------------

Use Globus Online web browser to transfer data files between your
PC/workstation and the WVU HPC systems. There are two dedicated servers,
data transfer nodes (DTNs), that are connected to \ `WVU's Science DMZ
(REX) <https://wvu.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=9806>`__ that
allow data to be transferred with low latency and high bandwidth across
WVU campus as well as to other locations around the globe. This space is
available for all researchers at WVU who need to temporarily store and
transfer data.  In addition to faster transfer speeds, Globus Online
also includes restartable file transfers in case a connection fails and
includes data checksumming to ensure data is correctly transferred.  

Logging in and transferring files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Visit \ `Globus
   Online <https://auth.globus.org/p/login?redirect_uri=%2Fv2%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D89ba3e72-768f-4ddb-952d-e0bb7305e2c7%26client_name%3Dglobus_webapp%26scope%3Durn%253Aglobus%253Aauth%253Ascope%253Aauth.globus.org%253Aview_identities%2520urn%253Aglobus%253Aauth%253Ascope%253Anexus.api.globus.org%253Agroups%2520urn%253Aglobus%253Aauth%253Ascope%253Atransfer.api.globus.org%253Aall%26response_type%3Dtoken%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.globus.org%252Fapp%252Flogin%26redirect_name%3DGlobus%2520Web%2520App%26state%3D29wjlgspim8l&client_id=89ba3e72-768f-4ddb-952d-e0bb7305e2c7>`__ to
   login. Select West Virginia University from the organizational list
   and login using your WVU Login username and password.
#. Navigate to the \ `Transfer
   Files <https://www.globus.org/xfer/StartTransfer>`__ page to start
   transferring files. Additional information about how to Login
   and Transfer Files can be found at \ `Globus: How to Get
   Started <https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/>`__.

**Note:** WVU's High Performance Computing (HPC) End Point is named
wvu#hpcdtn. You can search for other endpoints in the "Endpoint" Dialog
Box.

Transferring data to your local workstations/PC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To learn how to transfer data to your local workstation, you will need
to install Globus Connect Personal. Instructions on how to install
Globus Connect Personal is located at  `Globus: Globus Connect
Personal <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal>`__.  
Note: Globus Connect Personal is only needed to transfer files to your
personnel workstation/PC. Most major academic institutions already have
a Globus Connect Server installed, which allows you to transfer easily
to the remote institution. 

Share Data
----------

Use Globus Online to share your data files with researchers located at
other institutions around the world without needing administrative
assistance.

**Note:** If you are not using an endpoint that starts with "wvu#",
before you can start sharing data using Globus, you must contact
Research Computing and request that a shared endpoint be created for
you.

For instructions on how to share data with other researchers using
Globus, visit \ `Globus: How to Share Data Using
Globus <https://docs.globus.org/how-to/share-files/>`__.

Archive Data
------------

Globus Online provides an easy mechanism for researchers to archive
their data sets for free to their MIX Google Drive account via a `Google
Drive
Connector <https://docs.globus.org/premium-storage-connectors/google-drive/>`__.
All WVU faculty and students have unlimited storage in Google Drive
through their MIX account. Staff can request a MIX account by contacting
helpdesk@hpc.wvu.edu. Google Drive gives researchers a safe environment
to archive their data sets, which replicates between multiple data
centers to prevent data loss. Note: You can also use the Google Drive
web interface as well as the `Google Drive Sync
Client <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive>`__ to transfer files to
your Google Drive MIX account; however, the sync client and web
interface is best used for small files (Example .docx, .pdf, etc.).
Globus Google Drive Connector is optimized for transferring a large
number of files as well as very large files, which cannot be done, via
the Google Drive Web Interface on Sync Client. You will see the best
performance with Google Drive Connector with transferring several large
files at once. If you have many small files, it might be best to zip/tar
these files first before transferring to Google Drive.

**Google Drive is not approved for use of sensitive or protected data
sets (i.e. HIPPA, FERPA, ITAR, subject to Export Control laws, etc.). If
you need assistance archiving these types of data sets, please contact
helpdesk@hpc.wvu.edu.**

To archive data to a Google Drive you will need to follow the
instructions in the Globus Online Google Drive Connector Instructions,
which will guide you on how to make a Shared Endpoint that you can
attach to your MIX Google Drive Account to transfer data to/from.

`Globus Online Google Drive Connector Instructions <https://docs.globus.org/premium-storage-connectors/google-drive/#share_a_google_drive_folder_using_globus>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Note:** In step one, when searching all endpoints you will need to
   search for ‘wvu#gdrive’.

To transfer files to your MIX Google Drive Account, review the “Transfer
Data” Section above. You will want to select the name of the Shared
Endpoint you just created in step 3 as one of the two endpoints. The
other endpoint could be a WVU endpoint, such as wvu#hpcdtn or a personal
endpoint you created that connects to your workstation/PC.

Publish Data
------------

Use Globus Online to publish your datasets, possibly as a requirement
from a granting agency. Published datasets are organized by communities
and their member collections and are searchable by other Globus users.

**Note:** If you are not using an endpoint that starts with "wvu#",
before you can start sharing data using Globus, you must contact
Research Computing and request that a shared endpoint be created for
you.

Online, visit \ `Globus: Data Publication User
Guide <https://docs.globus.org/data-publication-user-guide/>`__.
